            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This application is the result of a 16 week project with the goal to make a positive impact on sustainability in Rotterdam. <br>
                Urban Jungle tries to make its impact by making users reflect on and confront their current sustainability 
                and providing help to improve it. <br>
                The endresult gives the user a quiz based on the object they scan.
                After the quiz the user sees a 3D model of Rotterdam adjusted to their sustainability.
                The app provides tips to help the user improve their sustainability. <br>

            <h2>My work</h2>
            <p>I worked on development of the quiz, 3D viewer and styling. <br>
                Besides development I worked on the concept, set up a usability test and made a rapport of it and did research. 
                I also worked on other project related stuff, like the Business Model Canvas, Empathy Map, Persona, Customer Journey and more.

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>We worked with React and Ionic to make the app a PWA. This means it can be build as a webapp and a native app. <br>
                I used Three.js, initially to use AR, but also to load the 3D models.
                The models are made using Blender and the object detection uses TenserFlow.js and the model Coco SSD. 
                These were used by other teammates. <br>
